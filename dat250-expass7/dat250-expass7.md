# Issues 
Had some issues with the sql dialect which is deprecated since we are using PostgreSQL 17

<br>
Also since I am using WSL I had to connect to the database through the IP of the WSL, not localhost. 

<br>
Had some issues with the persistence file that was given since it had no driver in it.
